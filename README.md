You must first create a 50x28 black and white image.
White pixels mean led off, black ones quite the opposite, take that into consideration when creating an image using Photopea / Photoshop / Gimp.
Put the target picture into the same dir as the py scripts.
Run generate_image.py
Paste the byte array into the data variable in test_generated_xbm.py and check if everything works out for you.
Enjoy!
